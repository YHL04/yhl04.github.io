Hi, I'm Yi Hung!

I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a passion for building smart, scalable systems. Over the years, I've explored a wide range of interests—from Machine Learning and Database Systems to Web Development—continually sharpening my skills through coursework, personal projects, and hands-on experience.
